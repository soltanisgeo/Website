I am Saeed Soltani. Last year Ph.D student at Universite Grenoble Alpes and International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology. 
My current research is focused on 3D modeling of sedimentary basins and their impact on seismic risk assessment. (Link: http://www.theses.fr/s212521)
My PhD project is divided into 2 main categories: 
1 - Construct the experimental 3D velocity model of the Tehran basin with an extensive integrated geophysical and geological approach to know about basin properties. 
2- Using this 3D velocity model for seismic strong ground motion simulations to predict a more realistic surface ground motion for future earthquakes by EFISPEC3D code. EFISPEC3D is a free code that solves the three-dimensional wave equations using spectral-element method. (Link : De Martin et al.  https://gitlab.brgm.fr/brgm/efispec3d).
