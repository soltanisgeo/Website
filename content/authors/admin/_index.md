I am **Saeed Soltani**. Last year Ph.D. student at [ISTERRE](https://www.isterre.fr) (Institut des science de la terre) and [IIEES](https://www.iiees.ac.ir/en/) (International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology).<br />
My current research is focused on 3D modeling of sedimentary basins and their impact on seismic risk assessment.<br />
My [PhD](https://www.theses.fr/s212521) is divided into 2 main categories:<br />
**1 -** Construct the experimental 3D velocity model of the Tehran sedimentary basin by combining extensive geophysical , geotechnical and geological data.<br />
**2 -** Using this 3D velocity model for seismic strong ground motion simulations by [EFISPEC3D](http://efispec.free.fr/) (DeMartin et al., 2013),  a free and open source spectral-element method code that solves the three-dimensional wave equations.<br />
