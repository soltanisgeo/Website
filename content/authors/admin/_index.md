I am **Saeed Soltani**. Last year Ph.D student at [Universite Grenoble Alpes](https://www.isterre.fr) and International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology.
My current research is focused on 3D modeling of sedimentary basins and their impact on seismic risk assessment.

My PhD project is divided into 2 main categories:
1 - Construct the experimental 3D velocity model of the Tehran sedimentary basin by combining extensive geophysical , geotechnical and geological data.
2-Using this 3D velocity model for seismic strong ground motion simulations by EFISPEC3D (DeMartin et al., 2013),  a free and open source spectral-element method (SEM) code that solves the three-dimensional wave equations.
