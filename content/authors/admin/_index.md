I am **Saeed Soltani**. A Ph.D. graduate from Universit√© Grenoble Alpes, [ISTERRE](https://www.isterre.fr) (Institut des science de la terre) and International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology,[IIEES](https://www.iiees.ac.ir/en/) with expertise in 3D modeling of sedimentary basins and its implications for seismic risk assessment.<br />
I have extensive experience in constructing experimental 3D velocity models by integrating various passive and active geophysical methods, as well as physics-based seismic ground motion simulations using the spectral-element method. <br />
