title: Determining of shear wave velocity in Dargahan region (Qeshm) using “RayDec” and “HVTFA” technique.
subtitle: Ms.C thesis By Faeze Amirian (Thesis Advisor: Saeed Soltani) , Institute of Geophysics , University of Tehran <!--more--> Near the northern coast of Qeshm Island in the city of Darghahan, a series of ambient noise vibrations were done by Haghshenas in 2010.<br /> This thesis attempted to extract shear wave velocity structure for soft and shallow deposits by inverting Rayleigh wave ellipticity in order to learn more about possible site effects.<br /> Ellipticity is defined as the ratio between the horizontal and the vertical Rayleigh wave particle motions, which is strongly related to the local soil structure. Since the 1970s, this method has been promoted and popularized experimentally (Nogoshi and Igarashi 1971, Yamakana et al., 1994) and numerically (Lachet and Bard 1994, Bard 1999). <br />The definition of Ellipticity depends on the noise wavefield and extracting pure properties of Rayleigh waves. <br />So, two methods were introduced to reduce the effects of body and Love waves from the wavefield.<br />HVTFA method define based on time-frequency analysis of the continuous wavelet transforms and the RayDec method by summing and stacking buffered signal windows.<br />The difference between the results of the two methods is less than 20%, and a comparison with the average boreholes VS30 reveals a shear wave velocity difference of less than 10%. However, this comparison makes it impossible to form a definitive opinion regarding sediment depth.<br />Finally, Similar to previous studies, the average frequency peak of 4 Hz indicates the presence of alluvium with relatively low thickness and low velocity in this region.<br /><br />
