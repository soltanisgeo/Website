This post introduces the European Tsunami Risk Service (ETRiS) and addresses its mission to collect, standardize, and disseminate data, data products, software, and services (DDSS) related to tsunami risk analysis. ETRiS is a part of the Thematic Core Service Tsunami and is integrated into the Data Portal of the European Plate Observing System (EPOS), which aims to ensure that the data and services adhere to the FAIR principles, making them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable by end users. The web platform of ETRiS, <a href="https://eurotsunamirisk.org/">https://eurotsunamirisk.org/</a>, provides virtual access to Data, Data products, Software, and Services (DDSS) for tsunami vulnerability and risk components, which are crucial for probabilistic tsunami risk analysis (PTRA). These DDSS include interactive maps, data products such as fragility and vulnerability curves, as well as open access software tools (the Tsunami Risk Modellerâ€™s Toolkit) for deriving fragility and vulnerability curves.
