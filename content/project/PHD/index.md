**PhD Thesis:**  Tehran, the capital of Iran, is located in the Southern part of the central Alborz, a region of very high seismicity due to the existence of several very large active faults. On the other hand, the city is built on a very thick alluvial deposits coming from the Alborz Mountains Range, giving the possibility to amplify the seismic waves and so increasing dramatically their impact on Tehran building stock. With these condition’s it is fundamental to best define the geometry/properties of the alluvial basin of Tehran in order to be able to predict a more realistic surface ground motion for future earthquakes.<br />
Past seismological studies revealed a large amplification of seismic ground motion over a broad frequency range (from 0.4 Hz to 4 Hz) but still there is no detailed knowledge related to the Tehran’s basin geometry/properties to be used for seismic strong ground motion simulations. Two phenomena suggested to explain such observed amplification: the first one is the existence of very thick sedimentary layers with a gradual increase in shear wave velocity in order to explain amplification at low frequency (0.4 Hz) and the second one is 2D-3D site effects caused by the deep 2D/3D sedimentary basin leading to amplification over a wide range of frequencies.<br />
In order to answer the origin of the amplification we constructed the first experimental 3D model of the Tehran basin.<br />
The final results based on strong ground motion simulations can help us to consider the importance of local site effects for the first time on the frameworks of Tehran seismic hazard assessment.<br />
