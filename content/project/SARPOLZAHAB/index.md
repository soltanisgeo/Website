Following the 2017 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake, various reconnaissance teams from the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology were gathered to investigate different aspects of this earthquake. Extensive fieldwork in the damaged areas revealed that the earthquake triggered a series of geotechnical phenomena, exacerbating the resulting damage. This report is derived from observations by the geotechnical research team of the International Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology and Kermanshah Razi University.<br />
