{{< hl >}}During the years, I participated in many different projects in Iran, mostly to study about local geotechnical condition and soil characterization. Each of these projects was done for a specific reason and necessity{{< /hl >}}
<br />
<br />

**1- Aq-Qala and Gomishan:** This project was defined after the heavy damages related to the flood of 2019 in Golestan province. The flood damage highlighted the importance of all types of natural hazards studies especially the local seismic hazards in the high-seismicity area filled by loess weak soils.<br />
**2- Faraghi:** Another project in Golestan province was done in Faraghi city. The city currently facing the problem of severe land subsidence due to the erosion of clay and loess soils. On the other hand the city was built recently from the integration of several villages affected by strong flood in 2004. So, the rapid development and population increase is increases the hazards for the city that encountered many possible natural hazards.<br />
**3- Kalpoosh:** Following the torrential rains in 2019, numerous landslides occurred in mountainous areas and instabe slopes in East Alborz region( North Semnan province ). One of the most important landslides occurred in the village of Kalpoosh (Hossein Abad Kalpoosh). In fact, Kalpoosh was built on a large old landslide and this area has been reactivated due to infiltration waters from the Kalpoosh dam and the rainfall and snowmelt caused by heavy snow in winter 2018.<br /> In addition to the reactivation, many other large and small landslides have occurred in the slopes around this village, which raised the necessity o comprehensive studies in this region. As part of this project, site effect studies was done in order to find the new location for the transfer of damaged houses in the uninhabitable parts.<br />
**4- Borojerd:** In this study, we tried to investigte the soil characterization and site conditions (soil class, VS30, velocity profiles) for seismic stations in Lorestan province using ambient noise vibrations method.<br />
**5- Mahshahr:** This project was carried out to evaluate  the seismic vulnerability and resiliency of structures in oil and gas facilities in southern Iran (Mahshahr special economic zone). Site effect and microzonation studies were carried out as part of this project's to complete the study objectives.<br />

**I was involved in these project in terms of:<br />**
**Extracting dispersion curves from active methods (MASW)<br />**
**Extracting dispersion curves (Rayliegh and Love) from passive methods (3-component F-K methods)<br />**
**H/V (process and interpretaion)<br />**
**F0 microzonation map <br />**
**F0-depth relation estimation <br />**
**Extracting Ellipticity curves (one station and multi station methods)<br />**
**Joint inversion of Eliipticities, Active and Passive arrays to extract shear wave velocity profiles<br />**
