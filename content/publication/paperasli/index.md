<strong>Abstract:</strong> The Tehran basin is located in the central Alborz seismic zone, a region with very high seismicity due to the presence of numerous large active faults. According to the model proposed by Engalenc (1968), the Plio-Quaternary alluviums of Tehran consist of homogenous cemented conglomerates estimated to be up to 1000 m thick. Analysis of earthquakes recorded by a temporary seismological experiment (Haghshenas, 2005) in the city of Tehran has outlined a significant amplification of ground motion (up to 7-8) over a wide frequency range from about 0.4 Hz to 8 Hz. Haghshenas (2005) suggested that such amplification is due to the existence of thick alluvial deposits associated with a strong impedance contrast at large depth and the presence of strong lateral discontinuities leading to multidimensional site effects. To better understand and predict the effects of the geometry and mechanical properties of the Tehran basin on surface ground motions, we developed a 3D shear-wave velocity model of Tehran’s basin by integrating all available geophysical, seismological, and geological data. Geological data include 197 available geotechnical or geological logs within Tehran city. For geophysical data, 33 seismic ambient vibration arrays with apertures ranging from 100 m to 200 m and 13 active surface wave profiles were used to derive shear-wave velocity profiles. Additionally, 884 single-station ambient vibration recordings (H/V data) have been integrated. Interestingly, the H/V method applied to seismic ambient
